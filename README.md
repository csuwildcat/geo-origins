Removing the friction from location-based triggering with origin-bound geofencing


## The Concept

Location-Based Triggers (iBeacons, RFID, etc.) are all the rage these days. Article after article touts the use of iBeacons, and other LBTs, to activate devices and apps base on your current, granular location. 

The Good News: LBTs are a great idea, and offer user and developers a ton of functionality, and allow for the creation of immersive, contextually relevant experiences.

The Bad News: In my work with LTBs, it became immediately clear platforms like Android and iOS friction, largely tied to apps
